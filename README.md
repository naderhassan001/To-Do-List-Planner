<h1 align="center">ToDo List Planner</h1>
This is a cool list planner that anyone can use to keep track of tasks and time. In the field, you can add an event and click enter to record that event and the timestamp.
When the curosr hovers over an event, that event becomes red. Click once to remove that event!
